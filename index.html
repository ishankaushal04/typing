            Hello I am Ishan Kaushal, I've developed an engaging web-based typing speed game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this interactive project, random paragraphs appear on the screen, challenging users to type them accurately within a 30-second timeframe. The application tracks their typing speed, providing immediate feedback in words per minute (WPM). Overcoming challenges, like accurately calculating WPM, strengthened my problem-solving skills. In the future, I plan to expand the game with features like difficulty levels and leaderboards. This project demonstrates my web development skills and commitment to continuous improvement.
